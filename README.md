  - Azure Virtual Machines, Blob Storage, Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database, Azure Active Directory, etc.
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
  - Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, Cloud SQL, Identity and Access Management (IAM), etc.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- Terraform
- AWS CloudFormation

### Containers and Orchestration

- Docker
- Kubernetes

### Networking

- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Subnets, Security Groups, and Network ACLs
- CDN and DNS Management

### Monitoring and Logging

- AWS CloudWatch
- Azure Monitor
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

### CI/CD

## Projects

### Project 1: Cloud-Based Web Application

- Deployed a scalable web application on AWS using EC2 instances, S3 for static content, and RDS for the database.
- Implemented auto-scaling and load balancing to ensure high availability.

### Project 2: Serverless Data Processing

- Developed and deployed serverless functions on AWS Lambda to process and analyze data from an S3 bucket.
- Utilized AWS EventBridge for event-driven architecture.

### Project 3: Kubernetes Deployment

- Orchestrated containerized applications using Kubernetes on GCP.
- Implemented rolling updates and managed deployments.

## Learning Path

My self-taught journey in cloud engineering involves a combination of online courses, documentation, and hands-on projects. Some of the key resources I've used include:

- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
- [Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals)
- [Google Cloud Training](https://cloud.google.com/training)

## Goals

I am continuously expanding my knowledge in cloud computing and aiming to achieve the following certifications:

- AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional
- Azure DevOps Engineer Expert
- Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect
